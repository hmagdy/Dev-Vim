# Using VIM as PHP IDE
I use Vim for all text editing, even software development. At one point I stopped using IDEs. One major reason is that Vim can do all the major things I need from IDEs (tabs, file trees, greping, syntax highlighting, indentation, completion, "quickfix"ing, etc).

And guess what? 

It's super faster, productive and **just amazing** ;)

	curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
